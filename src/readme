README!

Our team owns a command line interface (CLI) that customers use to interact with the server. The code you see here is a simplified and smaller version of this CLI.



Your job is to design and implement the help command for this CLI. Your help command should give essential information to customers about specific commands.
 The format for calling your help command can be whatever you think is best, but customers should be able to

1. See all of the commands available to them.

2. See specific and detailed help for specific commands as requested. Finally, you should develop a testing strategy for your help implementation
and create unit tests in HelpTests for ensuring the help command behaves as expected.



Since this is a simplified version of the CLI, we will assume that the args passed to the CommandExecutor begin with the command name e.g. args: ["help", "arg1", "arg2"].
 Again for simplification, output is returned as a string instead of to Standard.out.



Feel free to modify the existing code to suit your idea for what the best help user experience would be.
